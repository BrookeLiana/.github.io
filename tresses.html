          <h2>Tresses - Mobile Application</h2>
          <h3>Concept project</h3>
            <p>Tresses is a mobile application that allows users to search for and book a hairstylist
            within a certain vicinity of their current location, based off of their selected hair-type
            and desired hairstyle.

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>Going to a hair salon has become a luxury with busy, unpredictable schedules, children to watch and the increasing inconvenience of the
          time it takes to travel to a salon. Additionally, most mainstream salons do not have a wide range of styling knowledge for various hair types
          and the different kind of styling techniques that each of those different hair types require for maintaining healthy hair. Finally, there is a
          general lack of transparency and therefore no accountability held  for hairstylists when working with clients.
          </p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Tresses is an application that allows users to search for and hire a hairstylist near their current location, who will travel to their home
          to provide hairstyling services based off of the users’ selected hair type. Tresses aims to provide an inclusive hairstyling experience for a
          wide range of hair types (straight to very curly), and to use hairstyling techniques that encourages healthy hair. Tresses also allows users
          to view potential hairstylists for hire, their credentials, reviews, ratings and profile information prior to confirming them.

        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>An analysis of market competitors GlamSquad, beGlammed and ManeStream confirmed that Tresses would be a great
          addition that provides inclusive services for a wide range of hair types, and transparency regarding the credentials
          and resume of hairstylists. Neither of the examined competitors allowed for a user to input personal information regarding their hair type,
          or hair length, allowed the user to view a picture of the hair stylist who had been hired for service, offered a choice on the selection of hair stylist,
          or have any background or resume information available on the stylist.

        <p>A detailed flow diagram illustrated paths for new and returning users, booking a new hair appointment, selecting a stylist, selecting a hairstyle, inputting
          a current location and billing information and canceling an appointment. This comprehensive information architecture served as a template for the creation of the site.

        <h3>Visual Design</h3>
        <p>Tresses  is an application that is about inclusivity, flexibility, and women embracing their natural hair texture and having access to hairstyling no matter their hair type.
          The visual design of Tresses aims to reflect this and incorporates very natural tones, various shades of brown, terracotta, slate grey and utilizes a modern and minimalist typeface.

        <h3>Lo-Fi Wireframes</h3>
        <p>Low fidelity wireframes were developed and tested several times before they were finally ready to be developed with the visual design elements applied. Random users were selected to complete
           usability testing through an application  called inVision.  Users were asked to complete certain tasks through the use of different context stories. A numbering system was implemented where
           users were asked to rate each of their given tasks ranging in difficulty to ease from 1-4.  This helped to illuminate sore points in the design that had low ratings of 2 or below. Some of which
           included Canceling an appointment  and logging out; both of these options were not present depending on which page a user was currently on. Another sore point was that there wasn’t a confirmation
           that an appointment had successfully been canceled.

    <section class="conclusion">
      <div class="content-container">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p> Looking ahead to future iterations of this project, I would add more variety in the hairstyles offered, add the additional hair types that exist that were not included, flush out the stylist user flows and have
          the user be able to favorite stylists, leave reviews and share their finished hairstyling experience via social media</p>
