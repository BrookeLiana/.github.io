# Tresses

Tresses is a mobile application that allows users to search for and book a hairstylist
within a certain vicinity of their current location, based off of their selected hair-type
and desired hairstyle.

## Problem

Going to a hair salon has become a luxury with busy, unpredictable schedules, children to watch and the increasing inconvenience of the time it takes to travel to a salon. Additionally, most mainstream salons do not have a wide range of styling knowledge for various hair types and the different kind of styling techniques that each of those different hair types require for maintaining healthy hair. Finally, there is a general lack of transparency and therefore no accountability held for hairstylists when working with clients.

## Solution

Tresses is an application that allows users to search for and hire a hairstylist near their current location, who will travel to their home to provide hairstyling services based off of the usersâ€™ selected hair type. Tresses aims to provide an inclusive hairstyling experience for a wide range of hair types (straight to very curly), and to use hairstyling techniques that encourages healthy hair. Tresses also allows users to view potential hairstylists for hire, their credentials, reviews, ratings and profile information prior to confirming them.
